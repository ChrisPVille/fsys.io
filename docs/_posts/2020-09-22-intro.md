# New Site

I work on a number of weird and wonderful projects in my spare time, and it recently occurred to me that I should be sharing some of the things I've learned.  In the case of the [Nintendo 64 Disk Drive], I've probably poked and prodded that thing in ways no person outside of Japan has done, and I have an obligation to ensure that information doesn't get lost to time.

I will try to pull in at least the major projects I've already finished, and keep things vaguely together going forward.
